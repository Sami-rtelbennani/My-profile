     <h2>Basketball</h2>
      <p>
        I discovered basketball when I was 5 and fell in love with it. I played that sport since that day. I was playing professional in high school and I kept playing in a club team in Grenoble. That sport gave me values that were useful to me when I began my professional career, but also values that helped me build my strong personality.

    <h2>Geopolitic</h2>
      <p>
    Geopolitics is also one of my passions. I did many MUN Simulations before. Indeed, understanding our world is essential for our development and defending my ideas is a good way for me to understand other people's ideas.

    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <p>
    I am also extremly interested in Marketing and how it is becoming totally digitalized in our days. The marketing strategies that are being adapted to our actual society are a phenomenon that I want to understand and master. That is why IESEG is the right opportunity for me !
